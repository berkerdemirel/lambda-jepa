## 2026-07-02 — project kickstart
- Repo scaffolded from the approved kickstart plan (docs/report + plan in .claude/plans).
- Verified: ~/data/imagenet100 (CMC) vs ~/data/imagenet-100 share only 8/100 classes — different datasets. Canonical: imagenet100 (D-002).
- Verified: lejepa/sslx "emb" = trunk(384) + Linear(384→512) (timm num_classes=512) — h redefined as trunk forward_features; the Linear is head tap z.embed (D-003).
- solo-learn zoo checkpoint downloads discontinued as of 2026 → controlled retrains are the only route to head-preserving apples-to-apples checkpoints.
- Donor pinned: third_party/solo-learn @ 9187ea39c2c3f43c455ab06664d2b019a9802954 (2026-04-22).
